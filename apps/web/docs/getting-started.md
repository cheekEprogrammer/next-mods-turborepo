# Getting Started

We made using Next Mods as easy as possible. No installation needed, just run `npx next-mods` and go.

To start using Next Mods in your Next.js project, navigate to your project folder in the terminal, and then run:

```bash
npx next-mods init
```

This command will set up the essentials and guide you through the configuration process.

Once initialized, you can begin installing functions by using the [install](../docs/commands/install.md) command:

```bash
npx next-mods install <function>
```

For example, to install Supabase, run `npx next-mods install supabase`

:::info

If you accidentally (or purposley) break code after installing a function, you can re-install it by running `npx next-mods install <function> repair`

That's all you need to know to get started using Next Mods. You can now start installing functions!
