# Getting Started

We made using Next Mods as easy as possible. No installation needed, just run `npx next-mods` and go.

To start using Next Mods in your Next.js project, navigate to your project folder in the terminal, and then run:

```bash
npx next-mods init
```

This command will set up the essentials and guide you through the configuration process.
