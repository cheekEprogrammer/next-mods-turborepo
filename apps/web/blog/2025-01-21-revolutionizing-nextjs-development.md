Hello world, this is David. I wanted to share my excitement with the release of Next Mods and how this tool can help save many developer's time and headache when developing a Next.js app. Imagine a command line tool that can add a feature to your app that normally would take hours to set up. This is the main concept of Next Mods and I will be discussing this tool in more detail in this article.

## The Challenge with Manual Setup

If you have developed a Next.js app before, even if you have everything planned out, it can take a good few hours hour or so of your time to copy and paste code to add main features to your app. Also, most apps nowadays all share the same key components; authentication, payments and AI (Chatbots, processing, etc.).

Last year, everyone was pushing to "ship" things quickly and often. Even an senior developer would encounter a lot of manual work and time wasted setting projects up. There wasn't really a streamlined way to add major functionality with near zero effort. This is where I had the idea to create Next Mods.

## What is Next Mods?

Next Mods is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to enhance your Next.js development experience. Whether you're starting a new project or have an existing one, Next Mods takes the hassle out of adding essential functionalities, allowing you to focus on creating innovative features rather than getting bogged down in repetitive setup tasks.

Built with simplicity in mind, Next Mods enables developers to integrate popular tools and libraries effortlessly.

With simple commands, you can add complex functionalities like authentication, payment systems, or even AI functions in the blink of an eye. Imagine needing authentication; instead of painstakingly configuring multiple dependencies and files, you can get it up and running by issuing a single command: `npx next-mods install supabase`. Within about 30 seconds, you have a fully functioning authentication system ready to go. I'm not talking about empty boilerplate code... I'm talking about a full authentication system with signin, signup pages and even callback functions to handle OAuth and Email users.

Need to add payment processing with Stripe? Just run the relevant install command, and you’re set. It really is that easy!

## Key Functionalities and Features

Next Mods brings a suite of functionalities that drastically reduce development time and streamline the integration of necessary tools:

### One-Command Functionality

No more having to read long setup guides and complex configurations. Next Mods allows you to install and configure entire systems with just a couple of keystrokes, enabling you to set up your project’s core features almost instantaneously.

### Modular Configuration

Each functionality added through Next Mods is modular, meaning you only install the features you need without unwanted bloat. This keeps your project lightweight and tailored to your specific requirements.

### Preconfigured Best Practices

Next Mods doesn’t just add functionalities; it does so following industry best practices. Each installation comes preconfigured, ensuring that you adhere to recommended standards right from the start. We don't hand you over ugly unfinished code.

### Wide Range of Integrations

From authentication solutions like Supabase to payment integrations with Stripe and beyond, Next Mods supports a growing list of the most in-demand features that modern web applications typically require, making it an invaluable tool in your development toolkit.

### Community-Driven Growth

The Next Mods project thrives on community feedback and contributions. As you use the tool, you can suggest new features or libraries you'd like to see integrated. This collaborative approach ensures that Next Mods evolves alongside the needs of its users.

### Seamless Updates

As the landscape of web development is ever-changing, Next Mods keeps pace with updates to the libraries and frameworks you’re using. I use this tool myself every day. You can trust that any installed functionality will remain relevant and up-to-date, sparing you from the tedium of manual upgrades.

### Its Open Sourced and Free

Did I mention everything is open sourced and free? I am not looking to get rich from this, I just want to help contribute a useful tool to the Next.js community that can benefit everyone.

Next Mods is not just a tool; it’s a solution designed with developers in mind. It removes barriers, accelerates development timelines, and lets build with confidence. Whether you're a seasoned expert or just starting, you'll find that Next Mods transforms the way you approach Next.js projects.

## Comparing Next Mods to Traditional Boilerplates

In 2024, there was a flood of "Next.js boilerplates" that came out all around the same time that all promised to "ship fast". I bet any Next.js developer knows what i'm talking about. Almost every day there was a new "boilerplate" that is claiming to save you hours upon hours on end... if you pay them x amount of dollars upfront.

In the end, these boilerplates were just a Github repository with blank code that you had to copy and paste and mess around with. Sure, you were "saving time", but you were also adding time too. You also now had to follow someones way of coding and do things the way they laid out. We saw this blow up in one boilerplates face as it was riddled with security issues and was ridculed online. A quick Google search will show what I mean.

Next Mods wants to kill the whole boilerplate market. Nobody needs a boilerplate. I dont think you should have to pay for empty code. You are still having to do a LOT of manual work with a boilerplate.

In the end, compared to traditional boilerplates, Next Mods is free to use, follows industry standards and can guarantee to save you time, not add to it.

## Real-World Applications and Use Cases

I can only share my personal experience so far, but I used Next Mods to create a SaaS application in about 45 minutes now. In under an hour I had a fully done SaaS application that handled authentication, stripe subscriptions and even handled the whole backend with Supabase.

## Getting Started with Next Mods

I have created easy to read [documentation](../docs/Introduction) outlining how to use Next Mods and all the parts to it. You can get started by [following this guide](../docs/getting-started).

## Future of Next Mods

My goal for the immiedate future is to add the Stripe function and build a dashboard for you to be able to install into your project. I will be working on this every day so expect changes daily.

## Try Next Mods

I encourage you to give Next Mods a shot. You can try it right now by running `npx next-mods init` inside the root of your Next.js application. I would love to hear what you think about it and any feedback you have to make it even better. If you have a service or function you could find useful to add, let us know and we can get it added in.

I will be setting up a Discord group in the near future so keep an eye out for links to it. Next Mods will only be able to succeed from feedback and discussions. I promise this will be the last time you have to spend on getting a Next.js application setup.

## Conclusion

Next Mods is more than just a CLI tool... it’s a game-changer for Next.js developers. By removing the manual setup processes and offering a straightforward, one-command solution for integrating essential functionalities, Next Mods enables you to focus on what truly matters... bringing your ideas to life.

I invite you to join me on this journey. Try out Next Mods, share your experiences, and contribute to the growing ecosystem. Together, we can redefine what it means to develop with Next.js, making the process smoother, quicker, and more enjoyable for everyone involved. Thank you for being part of this exciting adventure!
